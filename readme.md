Do you hate email? I hate email. 

I especially hate emails with no actual content ("Thanks!") and FYI 
emails sent out to a large group of people. 

Lately I've been trying to make such emails a little less painful by
including a joke, useful tip, or clever quote. In other words, *I've
started pasting tweets into my email signature.*

This project will automate that process by periodically fetching 
favorited tweets and adding them to the signature list.

And yes, contributions are welcome. That's why I'm posting this on
Github, even though I haven't even decided what language to write
it in yet.
